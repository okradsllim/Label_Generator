# Introduction

## Purpose of the Label Generator

The Label Generator is a tool designed to automate the creation of archival box and folder labels from Encoded Archival Description (EAD) XML files exported from ArchivesSpace. It streamlines the labeling process for archival collections, specifically tailored for the Beinecke Library at Yale University.
