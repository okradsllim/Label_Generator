# Label Generator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Label Generator! This tool is designed to streamline the creation of archival box and folder labels according to the ArchivesSpace EAD2002 standard. It is aimed at improving efficiency by eliminating the need for network mapping/connectivity and supporting a variety of EAD structures.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

Perform these steps ONCE to prepare your environment:

#### A) Enable Macros in Microsoft Word
1. Open Microsoft Word.
2. Go to 'File' > 'Options' at the bottom.
3. In the left pane, select 'Trust Center' and click on 'Trust Center Settings...'.
4. Choose 'Enable all Macros' (Note: This is temporarily required for functionality, though it is the least secure option. Our organizationâ€™s network security measures are in place as a safeguard).

#### B) Prepare the Label Generator Folder
Navigate to ...MSSUNIT\Finding Aids\Labels\.
1. Copy the "LABEL_GENERATOR" folder (CTRL+C).
2. Paste it on your Desktop (CTRL+V) or another dedicated location on your local machine.

## Using the Tool

### Steps to Generate Labels
1. Export your EAD from ArchivesSpace ensuring 'Include unpublished' is checked and 'EAD3 schema' is unchecked.
2. Open the "LABEL_GENERATOR" folder on your local machine.
3. Double-click the Label_Generator application file.
4. Select your EAD file from the list presented (if multiple files are present).
5. Customize your labels by choosing to print box labels, folder labels, or both, selecting specific series or box numbers, and opting for customized labels if the boxes contain container type information.
6. Generate and print: The program will create the labels as Word documents, saved within the "Label Generator" folder, ready for printing.
