Label Generator: Quick Guide

Introduction

Welcome to the Label Generator! 

This tool is designed to streamline the creation of archival box and folder labels according to the ArchivesSpace EAD2002 standard. 
It improves upon existing systems by eliminating the need for network mapping/connectivity and by supporting a variety of EAD structures that the previous system could not handle. 
Please note, this app is still under development and may contain bugs.

For any issues, contact Will at william.nyarko@yale.edu. Thank you for using this program!

Getting Started: Initial Setup

Perform these steps ONCE to prepare your environment:

A) Enable Macros in Microsoft Word

	1.	Open Microsoft Word.
	2.	Go to 'File' > 'Options' at the bottom.
	3.	In the left pane, select 'Trust Center' and click on 'Trust Center Settings...'.
	4.	Choose 'Enable all Macros' (Note: This is temporarily required for functionality, though it is the least secure option. Our organizationâ€™s network security measures are in place as a 		safeguard. Future updates will address this security concern).

B) Prepare the Label Generator Folder
Navigate to ...MSSUNIT\Finding Aids\Labels\.

	1.	Copy the "LABEL_GENERATOR" folder (CTRL+C).

	2.	Paste it on your Desktop (CTRL+V) or another dedicated location on your local machine.

	This folder contains the Label_Generator application and a README file. The application icon resembles a wormy, yellow python on a black and blue diskette.


Running the Program

1.	Export your EAD from ArchivesSpace: Ensure 'Include unpublished' is checked and 'EAD3 schema' is unchecked.

2.	Open the "LABEL_GENERATOR" folder on your local machine.

3.	Double-click the Label_Generator application file.

4.	Select your EAD file from the list presented (if multiple files are present).

5.	Customize your labels:
		Choose to print box labels, folder labels, or both.
		Select specific series or box numbers.
		Opt for customized labels if the boxes contain container type information.
6.	Generate and print:
				The program will create the labels as Word documents, saved within the "Label Generator" folder, ready for printing.


Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors, ensure that your EAD files are properly downloaded and that the "Label Generator" folder is well-organized. For further assistance or advanced customization options, please do not hesitate to contact Will at the email provided above.
